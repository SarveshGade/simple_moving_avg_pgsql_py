***Creating a Simple Moving Average chart for a few stocks/crypto coins!***

Creates a SMA chart for the past day (15 min and 1 hr) if the stock/crypto exists in my Postgres database.

I have a constant task running that connects to a local PostgreSQL database that is updating with the price of a group of 10 stocks and crypto coins. I then used matplotlib to plot the simple moving average for these!
Used a Flask backend and created a simple HTML frontend.
